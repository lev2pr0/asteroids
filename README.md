# Asteroids

## Purpose

Asteroids is a [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! I built a simple video game, based on the classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). If you've never played before, you can take a look at this [version of the game](https://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/Games/asteroidsClassic/ateroids.html). The learning goals of this project are:

- Introduce you to multi-file Python projects
- Show you a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
- To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!
