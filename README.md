# Asteroids ☄️

## Purpose

Asteroids is a [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! I built a simple video game, based on the classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). If you've never played before, you can take a look at this [version of the game](https://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/Games/asteroidsClassic/ateroids.html). The learning goals of this project are:

- Introduction to multi-file Python projects
- Real-world use case for object-oriented programming
- To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!

## Installation 

1. Fork from the ``main`` branch
2. Download and extract .zip from your forked repository
3. Navigate to directory of extracted .zip in terminal; Example: `cd ~/user/downloads`
4. Create a virtual environment at the top level of your directory:
```python
python3 -m venv venv
```
5. Activate the virtual environment: 
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```
6. Should look like this: `(venv) username@MacBook-Pro-2 Asteroids %`
7. Install the requirements:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. Confirm pygame is installed: `python3 -m pygame`
